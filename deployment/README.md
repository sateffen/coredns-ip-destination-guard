# CoreDNS IP Destination Guard Deployment

This folder provides everything to get a recent version of CoreDNS compiled with
this plugin, as well as all other useful ones that I personally use. You can configure
the *plugin.cfg* file however you like, afterwards you just have to trigger the
*build.sh* file to get the new coredns version.

Additionally, you can use the example Corefile in this folder, to get your instance
running right away.
